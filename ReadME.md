# üåæ India Agriculture Data Analysis (EDA)

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores **India‚Äôs agricultural landscape** using district and state-level datasets.  
It performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights into crop production, yield efficiency, and trends across regions and time.  

The analysis aims to provide useful insights for **farmers, policymakers, and researchers** by identifying growth patterns, top producing states, and the impact of cultivated area on production.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
- **Source:** ICRISAT District Level Agriculture Data (CSV file)  
- **Features include:**
  - Crop-wise **production, yield, and area cultivated**
  - District and State names
  - Year of record
  - Major crops: Rice, Wheat, Maize, Millets, Sorghum, Sugarcane, Soybean, Oilseeds

---

## üîç Key Analysis & Insights
- **Top Producing States & Districts**
  - Top 7 states in **Rice Production** (Bar Plot)
  - Top 10 years of **Wheat Production in Uttar Pradesh**
  - Soybean & Oilseed Production by major states
- **Trend Analysis (50 years)**
  - Sugarcane Production (Line Plot)
  - Millet Production trends (Pie/Line charts)
  - Sorghum Production in **Kharif vs Rabi** by region
- **Comparative Studies**
  - **Rice vs Wheat Yield** across states
  - Impact of **cultivated area** on production for Rice, Wheat, Maize
- **Visualization Tools**
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for interactive charts
  - Power BI dashboard for real-time insights

---

## üìä Dashboard (Power BI)
A **Power BI interactive dashboard** was created with:  
- KPI Cards (Total Production, Yield, Area Cultivated)  
- Trend Line Charts (Crop production over years)  
- Comparative Visuals (Rice vs Wheat, Oilseeds by states)  
- Region-wise Drilldowns  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Visualization:** Power BI, Plotly  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VigneshEilik/India_Agriculture_EDA.git
   cd India_Agriculture_EDA


2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run Jupyter Notebook for EDA:

   ```bash
jupyter notebook

4. Open Power BI file (India_Agriculture.pbix) for dashboard view.

## üìå Future Enhancements

Integrate Machine Learning models to forecast crop production

Add climate & rainfall data for deeper insights

Deploy dashboard as a Streamlit Web App
